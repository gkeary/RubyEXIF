This project will:
start at a given directory.
recursively identify JPG files
find the 'DateTimeOriginal' for each of the files.

output a yaml file

yaml file  (for now) looks like:
  ---
  - - k1
    - taken_at: 2008-09-28 13:23:30 -04:00
      1: C:/exif/rubyexif/lib/JPGFiles/IMG_2118.jpg
      2: C:/exif/rubyexif/lib/JPGFiles/TestCopy/IMG_2118.jpg
  - - k2
    - taken_at:
      1: C:/exif/rubyexif/lib/JPGFiles/yaml_image.jpg



O
Pass each file to the EXIFTOOL executable and obtain all of the EXIF tags.
Collect data in a hash which is keyed by EXIF:DateTimeOriginal.
Identifying duplicates as it goes.

provide an output hash which identifies all duplicate photos.


installing ruby-debug-ide is a problem in Windows....
JetBrains has to get their act together.
For now, do not debug in RubyMine....

TODO:  work on tryme -- get it to dump some good yaml
TODO:  make a new module in tryme
TODO:  integrate tryme back into exif.rb
TODO:  understand the yaml file which I dump to


I think Rubymine does not use LIB and Test directories by default (they are possibly GEM specific folders ? )
